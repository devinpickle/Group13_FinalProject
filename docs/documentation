What program are we going to create?
    Our plan is to make a platformer game with enemies and the ability to shoot projectiles (similar to MegaMan/Metroid).
    A mockup drawing is included in docs folder.

What technologies will we use?
    Python, VS Code, and the arcade library

What features will we include?
    The game will surely have movement, jumping, platforms, and enemies.
    See wishlist below for more of what is planned for our game.



Things to add/Wishlist (organized by greatest priority to least):

    Game Scene:
        Player movement
        Collisions with platforms
        Enemies, movement, collisions
        Player attack
        Sound
        Score/health display
        Crouch
        Animations
        Large levels with scrolling

    Title Scene:
        Start Button
        Controls Button

    End Game Scene:
        Winner display
        Game over display

    Alpha Priorities:
    Player movement
    Collisions with platforms
    *Possibly-Enemies, movement, collisions

If I shared this with a friend, which features must work?
    The player movement, collisions, and enemies must
    be present and working in some way.

Which features am I the most excited about building?
    Devin: I'm most excited about getting the movement to work and building the interactions with platforms and enemies.
    I'm also excited to build a level as well.

Which features are the most unique to my program?
    A feature unique to our program will be combat and the shooting aspect. This feature with enemy
    interaction will add another layer of gameplay depth to our program.

Which features will I learn the most from implementing?
    Devin: I'll likely learn the most from implementing the movement, and the logic that comes with that.
    I feel like the enemies and shooting mechanic will also be very new, so I'll learn a lot from working with those parts too.

Do some features seem too far beyond my skill level?
    Devin: Some wishlist features definitely seem ambitious and possibly outside my skill level right now.
    I've never programmed an attack mechanic, screen scrolling, or animations so there will be a big learning
    curve for me.
