# Jumping Bullets
There are some dangerous enemies that you need to take care of. They could be robots or aliens,
but you need to defeat them and make it to the end. Don't let them touch you.

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and the Arcade Library installed 
and running on your machine. You can install Arcade by opening a terminal 
and running the following command.
```
python3 -m pip install arcade
```
After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the 
project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.
```
python3 .\JumpingBullets\__main__.py
```
OR
```
py .\JumpingBullets\__main__.py
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE 
and open the project folder. Select the main module inside the batter folder and 
click the "run" icon.
